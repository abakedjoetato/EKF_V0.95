# Server Data Isolation Implementation

## Problem Description
When servers were removed from the bot, only the server configuration was deleted, but the associated data (kill records, player stats, etc.) remained in the database. This caused issues when servers were later re-added, as their old data would still be present, potentially causing data contamination between servers.

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Comprehensive Data Cleanup Utility
Created `ServerDataCleanupUtil` class that manages the cleanup of all data associated with a server:
- Kill records deletion
- Player statistics reset
- Bounty data removal
- Faction data removal
- Local files cleanup
- Cache clearing

### 2. Parser State Management
Implemented `ParserStateManager` to handle:
- Pausing parsers during critical operations like server removal
- Preventing race conditions during data operations
- Providing a central management system for parser states

### 3. Optimized CSV Processing
Enhanced CSV parsers to:
- Only process the newest CSV files (performance improvement)
- Skip already processed files
- Check for parser paused states before processing
- Limit memory usage for processed file tracking

### 4. Historical Data Processing
Added `ProcessHistoricalDataCommand` that:
- Allows admins to safely process historical data
- Pauses regular parsers during processing
- Provides options to clear existing data
- Gives detailed feedback on processing results

### 5. Enhanced Server Removal
Updated `ServerCommand.removeServer()` to:
- Pause parsers before removing a server
- Use the data cleanup utility to remove all associated data
- Provide detailed reporting on what was cleaned up
- Handle exceptions gracefully and prevent zombie servers
- Resume/reset parser states even if errors occur

### 6. Server Isolation Testing
Added `TestServerIsolationCommand` to verify isolation:
- Simulates server removal and re-addition
- Verifies no data persists after removal
- Confirms clean state after re-adding a server
- Provides detailed test results to administrators

## Benefits
1. Complete data isolation between servers
2. Proper cleanup of all resources when servers are removed
3. Prevention of data contamination between different servers
4. Better resource management through optimized parsers
5. Improved error handling and reporting
6. Administrative tools for testing and verification

## Future Improvements
1. Add more granular cleanup options
2. Implement data backup/restore functionality
3. Add server migration tools for moving data between guilds
4. Enhance monitoring and reporting of data integrity issues

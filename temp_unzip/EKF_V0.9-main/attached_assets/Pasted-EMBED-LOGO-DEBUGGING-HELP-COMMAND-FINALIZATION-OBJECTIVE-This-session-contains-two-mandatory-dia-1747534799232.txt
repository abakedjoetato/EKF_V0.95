EMBED LOGO DEBUGGING + HELP COMMAND FINALIZATION

OBJECTIVE

This session contains two mandatory diagnostic and implementation phases:

1. Deep analysis and resolution of missing logos in embed thumbnails


2. Completion of the help command system according to design expectations



You must not assume functionality. All fixes must be validated via live Discord results, build success, and behavioral output.


---

PHASE 1 — EMBED LOGO ANALYSIS & IMAGE CORRECTION

Issue:

Despite previous embed modernization, all active embed outputs (e.g., killfeed, bounties, stats, leaderboards, joins, disconnects) continue to omit thumbnail logos, or display broken/unstyled fallback formats.

Diagnostic Steps:

[ ] Trace all instances of setThumbnail(...) in codebase

[ ] Confirm if images are:

Attached locally as "attachment://filename.png"

Or served via a remote CDN URL


[ ] Validate that all logos are in:

Transparent .png format

Proper dimensions (80x80–128x128)

Accessible at runtime by the bot


[ ] Check if thumbnails are being overwritten or stripped by:

Embed overwrite logic

Improper .clear() or .setImage() calls

Discord CDN blocking



Fix Tasks:

Ensure each embed type calls:

embed.setThumbnail("attachment://deadside_logo.png");

or

embed.setThumbnail("https://cdn.example.com/deadside_logo.png");

Validate that:

The logo appears on the right side in Discord

Transparency is preserved (no fallback background)

No embed falls back to generic design or no image



Validation:

Manually trigger at least one of each embed output (kill, join, bounty, leaderboard, stat)

Screenshot or log output confirmation of visible, styled logos in each case

Confirm that thumbnail presence does not break existing layout or theming



---

PHASE 2 — HELP COMMAND SYSTEM COMPLETION

Objective:

Complete the /help command to display a well-organized, paginated or sectioned command reference panel for all slash commands.

Design Requirements:

Use an advanced embed format

Title: Deadside Bot Command Reference

Footer: Powered by Discord.gg/EmeraldServers

Sections to include:

Player Commands

Admin/Moderator Commands

Premium/Linked-only Features


Each command entry must list:

Command name

Brief description

Access level (e.g., User, Admin, Linked)



Fix Tasks:

[ ] Implement help menu in paginated form if >6 sections or commands

[ ] Ensure /help is:

Fully registered

Visible in Discord

Executable without error


[ ] Embed must use proper logo and embed styling per Phase 1


Validation:

Execute /help in Discord

Verify output:

Embed format is consistent with all other commands

All expected commands are represented

Help data is up-to-date and grouped correctly




---

EXECUTION RULES

You must perform all steps in a single uninterrupted batch.

Do not pause for logs, commits, or checkpoints

All work must compile under Maven and complete startup validation

No assumption of success is allowed—only real-world confirmation



---

COMPLETION CHECKLIST

Print only if every validation is met:

[✓] All embeds now display correct logos with transparency
[✓] Help command fully functional and correctly formatted
[✓] Bot compiles, registers all commands, and confirms online

If any test fails:

[!] EMBED OR HELP COMMAND FAILURE — MANUAL RE-EXECUTION REQUIRED
